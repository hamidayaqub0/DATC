# Decentralized Autonomous Time Capsule (DATC)

A blockchain-based platform for creating, preserving, and delivering time-locked digital messages and experiences across generations.

## Overview

The Decentralized Autonomous Time Capsule (DATC) system enables users to create digital time capsules containing messages, media, and experiences that are securely preserved and automatically delivered at specified future dates. Built on blockchain technology, the system ensures message persistence and tamper-proof delivery through a distributed network of future nodes.

## Key Features

### Time-Locked Message Creation
- Create encrypted messages with specified delivery dates
- Support for multiple content types (text, images, video, 3D assets)
- Optional AR/VR experience packaging
- Multi-signature creation and recipient designation

### Decentralized Storage
- Content distributed across future node network
- IPFS-based redundant storage system
- Tokenized storage incentives
- Automated health checks and content verification

### Smart Contract System
- Automated delivery scheduling
- Token economics for node operators
- Inheritance and contingency planning
- Multi-party validation requirements

### Future Node Network
- Stake-based node participation
- Periodic proof-of-storage validation
- Reputation scoring system
- Node reward distribution

### AR/VR Integration
- Immersive time capsule creation interface
- 3D spatial message placement
- Interactive content experiences
- Virtual time capsule galleries

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Core contracts:
TimeCapsuleFactory.sol    // Creates and manages individual time capsules
FutureNodeRegistry.sol    // Handles node registration and reputation
StorageToken.sol          // Manages storage incentive tokens
DeliveryOracle.sol        // Validates delivery conditions
```

### Storage Layer
- IPFS for distributed content storage
- Encrypted message sharding
- Redundancy protocols
- Content verification system

### Node Infrastructure
- Stake requirement: 10,000 DATC tokens
- Minimum 99.9% uptime requirement
- Regular proof-of-storage submissions
- Automated failover mechanisms

## Token Economics

### DATC Token
- Utility token for platform operations
- Node staking requirements
- Storage payment medium
- Governance participation

### Storage Credits
- Burned to create time capsules
- Dynamic pricing based on:
    - Storage duration
    - Content size
    - Required redundancy level

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum wallet
- DATC tokens for creating time capsules
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/datc-platform

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Start local development environment
npm run dev
```

### Creating a Time Capsule
1. Connect wallet to platform
2. Choose capsule creation options
3. Upload content and set delivery parameters
4. Stake required tokens
5. Configure recipient details
6. Sign and deploy capsule contract

## Development Setup

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run local blockchain
npm run chain

# Deploy contracts
npm run deploy

# Run test suite
npm run test
```

### Environment Variables
```
ETHEREUM_NETWORK=mainnet
INFURA_KEY=your_infura_key
FUTURE_NODE_MIN_STAKE=10000
STORAGE_REDUNDANCY_FACTOR=3
```

## Security Considerations

### Message Security
- End-to-end encryption
- Multi-factor authentication
- Key sharding and recovery
- Regular security audits

### Smart Contract Safety
- Multiple independent audits
- Formal verification
- Upgrade mechanisms
- Emergency pause functionality
